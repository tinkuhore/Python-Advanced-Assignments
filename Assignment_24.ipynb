    "# What would the goal be? Can you think of a situation where it would be beneficial?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Yes, it is permissible to use several import statements to import the same module in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "One situation where it would be beneficial is when you have a large Python project with multiple modules that use the same module or functions. Instead of repeating the import statement in every module, you can import the module once in a separate file and then use it in other modules by importing that file. This can help to reduce redundancy and make the code more organized."

    "# Q3. Circular importing, such as when two modules import each other, can lead to dependencies and bugs that aren't visible. How can you go about creating a program that avoids mutual importing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: To avoid circular importing and mutual dependencies between modules, it is important to design the code architecture carefully. Here are some strategies to follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use dependency injection: Rather than importing a module directly, you can pass an instance of the module as an argument to the function or class that needs it. This way, you don't need to import the module until it's actually needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a separate module for shared functionality: Instead of importing modules directly from each other, you can create a third module that contains all the shared functionality, and import that module into the other modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reorganize the module structure: If circular importing is causing issues, you may need to reorganize the module structure of your program. This could involve breaking up large modules into smaller ones, or consolidating smaller modules into larger ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use relative imports: Rather than using absolute imports, which specify the full path to a module, you can use relative imports to import modules that are located in the same package. This can help avoid circular importing because it allows modules to refer to each other using a relative path.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these strategies, you can help ensure that your program avoids circular importing and mutual dependencies, and is easier to maintain and debug."

    "When the \"from module import *\" syntax is used, only the symbols listed in __all__ are imported, which can prevent the import of symbols that should be considered private to the module.\n",

    "\n",
    "Efficient execution: The program counter can keep track of the current line of code being executed, enabling the interpreter to execute the script more efficiently.\n",

    "Error handling: If the interpreter encounters an error while executing the script, the program counter can provide information on the exact line where the error occurred, making it easier to debug the code.\n",

    "Conditional branching: The program counter can be used to implement conditional branching in the script, allowing the interpreter to execute different lines of code based on certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops: The program counter can be used to implement loops in the script, allowing the interpreter to repeat certain lines of code multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
