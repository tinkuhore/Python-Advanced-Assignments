    "\n",
    "Exception processing is a way of handling errors that occur during the execution of a program. Here are three applications for exception processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Error reporting: Exception processing can be used to report errors that occur during the execution of a program. By catching exceptions and logging them, developers can get an idea of what is going wrong with the program and where to fix the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input validation: Exception processing can be used to validate user input. By catching exceptions that occur when invalid input is entered, developers can prompt the user to re-enter the input or take other corrective action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource management: Exception processing can be used to manage resources such as files, databases, and network connections. By catching exceptions that occur when accessing or releasing resources, developers can ensure that the resources are properly managed and that the program doesn't crash or leak resources.Q1. Describe three applications for exception processing.\n",

    "# Q2. What happens if you don't do something extra to treat an exception?\n",
    "\n",
    "If an exception is raised and not caught, the program will terminate and an error message will be displayed. This can be undesirable, as it means that the program has failed to complete its task and may have left resources in an undefined state. To handle exceptions, developers can use try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions in a controlled manner."

    "Handle the exception and continue execution: In some cases, the program can handle the exception and continue execution. For example, if a file is not found, the program can create a new file and continue processing.\n",

    "Exit gracefully: In some cases, the program cannot recover from the exception and must exit gracefully. In this case, the program should release any resources it is using and log the error before terminating."
